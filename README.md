Records of algorithms on Dart according to Timofey Khiryanov's course "Algorithms in Python 3"
([link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDzFCPr95fK7tr47883DFUbm4GeOjjc0)).

***The purpose*** - *to refresh knowledge of algorithms and then move on to a practical course of algorithms*.  

The **course** itself is in Python, 
but I code the algorithms in Dart as I'm currently code in Dart and study the Dart under the hood.
